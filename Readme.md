# CamYa - camera app for Android that is capable of sending videos to Yandex.Disk storage

This camera app was created as a training project to learn how to use Camera2 API. It is designed
to be used as a stationary video camera that detects movement and start recording accordingly. 

The navigation is done with Intents, because it is simple and it does not make sense to use some 
advanced techniques there. The same can be said about most other things - for now it is just an MVP
prototype.

For interaction with Yandex.Disk [their SDK][1] was used
